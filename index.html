     ABOUT MISTY:
  <div>
  Misty Copeland is one of the most amazing women in the ballet industry right now. She is the first African American Principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre and has gone through a lot to get where she is now. Misty came from nothing living in a motel with her 5 siblings trying to do big things for herself. Her first 3 months doing ballet she got onto pointe making her a very strong dancer and want her to keep going with the amazing talent that she has. Their were setbacks being that yes she came from having nothing but also the struggle of as her dream came true and she became something she ends up having surgery on her left tibia having a plate screwed in. She was out of dance for awhile and almost lost her dream of becoming a dancer but she ends up getting back up and going for her dream and doing what she wanted. Mindy is Inspirational and is somebody that I look up to when I think of how I want to be a great dancer in the future.
